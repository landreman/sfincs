# This makefile is used for a mac laptop or desktop computer in which
# SFINCS's dependencies (PETSc, mumps, hdf5, netcdf) have been installed
# using the macport package management system.

# As of 2016-03-30, the following macports packages worked:
# sudo port install petsc +gcc5 +mumps +parmetis
# sudo port select --set mpi mpich-gcc5-fortran
# sudo port install hdf5 +fortran +gcc5
# sudo port install netcdf +gcc5 -dap
# sudo port install netcdf-fortran +gcc5

# To install the various python packages used by sfincsScanPlot,
# the following worked on 2016-03-30:
# sudo port install py27-h5py +gcc5
# sudo port select --set python python27
# sudo port select --set python2 python27
# sudo port select --set cython cython27
# sudo port install py27-scipy +gcc5
# sudo port install py27-matplotlib
